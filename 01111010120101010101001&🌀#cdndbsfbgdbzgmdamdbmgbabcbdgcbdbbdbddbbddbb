Satis
Simple static Composer repository generator.

Build Status codecov

Run from source
Install satis: composer create-project composer/satis:dev-master
Build a repository: php bin/satis build <configuration-file> <output-dir>
Read the more detailed instructions in the documentation.

Run as Docker container
Pull the image:

docker pull composer/satis
Run the image (with Composer cache from host):

docker run --rm --init -it \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -v $(pwd)/build:/build \
  -v "${COMPOSER_HOME:-$HOME/.composer}:/composer" \
  composer/satis
If you want to run the image without implicitly running Satis, you have to override the entrypoint specified in the Dockerfile:

--entrypoint /bin/sh
Purge
If you choose to archive packages as part of your build, over time you can be left with useless files. With the purge command, you can delete these files.

php bin/satis purge <configuration-file> <output-dir>
Note: don't do this unless you are certain your projects no longer reference any of these archives in their composer.lock files.

Updating
Updating Satis is as simple as running git pull && composer install in the Satis directory.

If you are running Satis as a Docker container, simply pull the latest image.
