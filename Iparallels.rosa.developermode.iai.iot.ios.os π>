Downloads songs from YouTube in an MP3 format by using Spotify's HTTP link.
Can also download a song by entering its artist and song name (in case if you don't have the Spotify's HTTP link for some song).
Automatically applies metadata to the downloaded song which includes:

Title, Artist, Album, Album art, Lyrics (if found on lyrics wikia), Album artist, Genre, Track number, Disc number, Release date, and more...
Works straight out of the box and does not require you to generate or mess with your API keys (already included).

Below is how your music library will look!

Python 2 compatibility was dropped because of the way it deals with unicode (2020 is coming soon too). If you still need to use Python 2 - check out the (outdated) python2 branch.

spotify-downloader works with all major distributions and even on low-powered devices such as a Raspberry Pi.

spotify-downloader can be installed via pip with:

$ pip3 install spotdl
but be sure to check out the Installation wiki page for detailed OS-specific instructions to get it and other dependencies it relies on working on your system.
