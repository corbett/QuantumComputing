Usage

Import FileBrowser at the top of the Swift file.

import FileBrowser
To show the file browser, all you need to do is:

let fileBrowser = FileBrowser()
present(fileBrowser, animated: true, completion: nil)
By default, the file browser will open in your app's documents directory. When users select a file, a preview will be displayed - offering an action sheet of options based on the file type.

Advanced Usage

You can open FileBrowser in a different root folder by initialising with an NSURL file path of your choice.

let fileBrowser = FileBrowser(initialPath: customPath)
You can also allow editing/deleting files.

let fileBrowser = FileBrowser(initialPath: customPath, allowEditing: true)
Use the didSelectFile closure to change FileBrowser's behaviour when a file is selected.

fileBrowser.didSelectFile = { (file: FBFile) -> Void in
    print(file.displayName)
}
To exclude a certain file type or a specific file path:

fileBrowser.excludesFileExtensions = ["zip"]
fileBrowser.excludesFilepaths = [secretFile]
Setting up with CocoaPods
